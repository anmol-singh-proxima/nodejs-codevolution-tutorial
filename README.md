# nodejs-codevolution-tutorial

- I will learn nodejs from the nodejs playlist of the YouTube channel 'Codevolution'
- I will add all the files or documents collected while learning nodejs in this repo
- After completing this course, I will create a small website with the help of the files generated at the end of the course
- In the website, I will create:
  - A menu-section to show all the topics to navigate to the topics content
  - A main-section to show the contents of the topics with the written explanation and corresponding code for easy readbility and understandibility
